    <p>The master <b>uploads</b> the vacation photo's in the order of the home screen. The board will help you with the type of photo's that need to be uploaded.</p>
    <p>As an <b>involved player</b> you will have to wait for the master to upload the photo's. You can then start to customize the photo's with stickers, one of a kind titles and rib-tickling descriptions.</p>

      <p>At the end of this trip, the master can acquire the personalized cards, with the rest of the deck, so the game is playable for hours on end.</p>
      <p>If your group is planning on working out more trips, and don't want to have multiple extended decks and game boards, you can choose to only acquire the personalized game cards.</p>
